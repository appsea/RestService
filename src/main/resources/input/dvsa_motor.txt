Question:
You're in a line of traffic. The driver behind you is following very closely. What action should you take?

A. Slow down, gradually increasing the gap between you and the vehicle in front
B. Signal left and wave the following driver past
C. Move over to a position just left of the centre line of the road
D. Ignore the following driver and continue to travel within the speed limit

Answer: A
Description: If the driver behind is following too closely, there’s a danger they’ll collide with the back of your vehicle if you stop suddenly. You can reduce this risk by slowing down and increasing the safety margin in front of you. This reduces the chance that you’ll have to stop suddenly and allows you to spread your braking over a greater distance. This is an example of defensive driving.

A. 12 metres (39 feet)
B. 15 metres (49 feet)
C. 10 metres (32 feet)
D. 20 metres (66 feet)

Answer: C
Description: Don’t park within 10 metres (32 feet) of a junction (unless in an authorised parking place).
