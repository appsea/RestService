Question:
Overall stopping distance is made up of thinking distance and braking distance. You're on a good, dry road surface, with good brakes and tyres. What's the typical braking distance from 50 mph?

A. 24 metres (80 feet)
B. 38 metres (125 feet)
C. 55 metres (180 feet)
D. 14 metres (46 feet)

Answer: B
Description: Be aware that this is just the braking distance. You need to add the thinking distance to this to give the overall stopping distance. At 50 mph, the typical thinking distance will be 15 metres (50 feet), plus a braking distance of 38 metres (125 feet), giving an overall stopping distance of 53 metres (175 feet). The stopping distance could be greater than this, depending on your attention and response to any hazards. These figures are a general guide.

Question:
In heavy motorway traffic, the vehicle behind you is following too closely. How can you lower the risk of a collision?
image: cttk2018.jpg

A. Switch on your hazard warning lights
B. Increase your distance from the vehicle in front
C. Move onto the hard shoulder and stop
D. Brake sharply

Answer: B
Description: On busy roads, traffic may still travel at high speeds despite being close together. Don’t follow the vehicle in front too closely. If a driver behind seems to be ‘pushing’ you, gradually increase your distance from the vehicle in front by slowing down gently. This will give you more space in front if you have to brake, and will reduce the risk of a collision involving several vehicles.
Category: Safety margins

Question:
You're following other vehicles in fog. You have your lights on. What else can you do to reduce the chances of being in a collision?

A. Keep close to the vehicle in front

Question:
Anti-lock brakes reduce the chances of skidding. When is this particularly important?

A. When you're driving down steep hills
B. When you're braking during normal driving
C. When you're driving on good road surfaces
D. When you're braking in an emergency

Answer: D
Description: The anti-lock braking system (ABS) will operate when the brakes have been applied harshly and the wheels are about to lock, such as during an emergency. ABS will reduce the likelihood of your car skidding, but it isn't a substitute for safe and responsible driving.
Category: Safety margins

Question:
On what type of road surface may anti-lock brakes not work effectively?

A. Firm
B. Smooth
C. Loose
D. Dry

Answer: C
Description: Poor contact with the road surface could cause one or more of the tyres to lose grip on the road. This is more likely to happen when braking in poor weather conditions and when the road has a loose, slippery or uneven surface.
Category: Safety margins

Question:
When are anti-lock brakes of most use to you?

A. When you’re braking on a motorway
B. When you’re braking on rural roads
C. When you’re braking harshly
D. When you’re braking gently

Answer: C
Description: Anti-lock brakes won't be needed when you're braking normally. Looking well down the road and anticipating possible hazards could prevent you from having to brake late and harshly. Knowing that you have anti-lock brakes isn't an excuse to drive in a careless or reckless way.
Category: Safety margins

Question:
What does driving a vehicle with anti-lock brakes allow you to do?

A. Brake harder because it's impossible to skid
B. Steer and brake harshly at the same time
C. Pay less attention to the road ahead
D. Drive at higher speeds

Answer: B
Description: If the wheels of your vehicle lock, they won't grip the road and you'll lose steering control. In good conditions, the anti-lock braking system (ABS) will prevent the wheels from locking and you'll keep control of your steering. In poor weather conditions or on loose surfaces, the ABS may be less effective.

Question:
You're driving along a wet road. How can you tell if your vehicle’s tyres are losing their grip on the surface?

A. The steering will feel very light
B. The engine will stall
C. The steering will feel very heavy
D. The engine noise will increase

Answer: A
Description: If you drive at speed in very wet conditions, your steering may suddenly feel lighter than usual. This means that the tyres have lifted off the surface of the road and are skating on the surface of the water. This is known as aquaplaning. Reduce speed but don’t brake until your steering returns to normal.

You're driving on an open road in dry weather. What should the distance be between you and the vehicle in front?
image: cttk2021.jpg

A. A two-second time gap
B. Two metres (6 feet 6 inches)
C. Two car lengths
D. One car length

Answer: A
Description: One way of checking there's a safe distance between you and the vehicle in front is to use the two-second rule. To check for a two-second time gap, choose a stationary object ahead, such as a bridge or road sign. When the car in front passes the object, say 'Only a fool breaks the two-second rule'. If you reach the object before you finish saying the phrase, you're too close and need to increase the gap.

Question:
How can you use your vehicle’s engine as a brake?

A. By changing to a higher gear
B. By changing to a lower gear
C. By selecting reverse gear
D. By selecting neutral gear

Answer: B
Description: When driving on downhill stretches of road, selecting a lower gear gives increased engine braking. This will prevent excessive use of the brakes, which become less effective if they overheat.
Category: Safety margins

Question:
When are anti-lock brakes (ABS) most effective?

A. When you keep pumping the foot brake to prevent skidding
B. When you brake promptly and firmly until you've stopped
C. When you brake normally but grip the steering wheel tightly
D. When you apply the handbrake to reduce the stopping distance

Answer: B
Description: If you have ABS and need to stop in an emergency, keep your foot firmly on the brake pedal until the vehicle has stopped. When the ABS operates, you may hear a grating sound and feel vibration through the brake pedal. This is normal and you should maintain pressure on the brake pedal until the vehicle stops.

Question:
When will anti-lock brakes take effect?

A. When you don't brake quickly enough
B. When you haven't seen a hazard ahead
C. When the wheels are about to lock
D. When you're speeding on a slippery road surface

Answer: C
Description: If your car is fitted with anti-lock brakes, they'll only activate when they sense that the wheels are about to lock. By preventing the wheels from locking, you'll be able to steer to avoid the hazard, while maximum braking is also applied.

What can result when you travel for long distances in neutral (known as coasting)?

A. Improvement in control
B. Easier steering
C. Reduction in control
D. Increased fuel consumption

Answer: C
Description: Coasting is the term used when the clutch is held down, or the gear lever is in neutral, and the vehicle is allowed to freewheel. This reduces the driver’s control of the vehicle. When you coast, the engine can’t drive the wheels to stabilise you through a corner, or give the assistance of engine braking to help slow the car.

Category: Vehicle handling

Question:
When will you feel the effects of engine braking?

A. When you only use the handbrake
B. When you change to a lower gear
C. When you're in neutral
D. When you change to a higher gear

Answer: B
Description: When you take your foot off the accelerator, engines have a natural resistance to turn, caused mainly by the cylinder compression. Changing to a lower gear requires the engine to turn faster and so it will have greater resistance than when it's made to turn more slowly. When going downhill, changing to a lower gear will therefore help to keep the vehicle's speed in check.

Why is it dangerous to leave rear fog lights on when they’re not needed?

A. They may be confused with brake lights
B. Electrical systems could be overloaded
C. The bulbs would fail
D. Direction indicators may not work properly

Answer: A
Description: If your rear fog lights are left on when it isn’t foggy, the glare they cause makes it difficult for road users behind to know whether you’re braking or you’ve just forgotten to turn off your rear fog lights. This can be a particular problem on wet roads and on motorways. If you leave your rear fog lights on at night, road users behind you are likely to be dazzled and this could put them at risk.
