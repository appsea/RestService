end;
end;
run;

D. data Quarterly;
set Sales;
array quarter{4};
array month{4,3};
do i=1 to dim(quarter);
quarter{i}=0;
do j=1 to dim(month);
quarter{i}+month{i,j};
end;
end;
run;

Answer: C
Description: Defining the array Qtr{4} creates the numeric variables Qtr1, Qtr2, Qtr3, Qtr4, which will be used to sum the sales for each quarter. Defining the array m{4,3} puts the variables Month1 through Month12 into four groups of three months (yearly quarters). A nested DO loop is used to reference the values of the variables Month1 through Month12 and to calculate the values of Qtr1 through Qtr4. the variables i and j are used only for loop processing. Each element in the Qtr array represents the sum of one row in the m array. The number of elements in the Qtr array should match the first dimension of the m array (that is, the number of rows in the m array). The first DO loop executes once for each of the four elements of the Qtr array.The assignment statement, qtr{i}=0, sets the value of qtr{i} to zero after each iteration of the first DO loop. Without the assignment statement, the values of Qtr1, Qtr2, Qtr3, and Qtr4 would accumulate across iterations of the data step due to the qtr{i}+m{i,j} sum statement within the DO loop. The second DO loop executes the same number of times as the second dimension of the m array (that is, the number of columns in each row of the m array).

else if i > 32 then j=16;
else j=20;

A. 15
B. 20
C. 16
D. . (missing)

Answer: B
Description: Whenever SAS does not find a mapping for some value in the format it prints the value as it is.

Question:
Consider the following code which generates a data set and creates a third variable utilizing the first two:

data Bonds;
input CouponRate $ ParValue $;
datalines;
8% $1000
9% $1200
8% $1500
5% $900
6% $750 
;

data BondCoupons;
set Bonds;
Coupon= CouponRate/100 * ParValue;
run;
proc print data=bondcoupons;
run;

You may assume the first code chunk runs properly. When printing after running the second code chunk, which of the following will be the value of the first observation of the variable Coupon and why?

A. The variable coupon value will have missing values because SAS was not able to correctly interpret the character values as numeric values and an error resulted when creating the Coupon variable.
B. The coupon value will be 80 because SAS ran flawlessly without producing errors or special notes in the log.
C. The coupon value will be 80 because SAS automatically converts character values into numeric values before algebraic manipulation.
D. The proc print procedure will fail because the BondCoupons data set was not successfully created.

Answer: A
Description: Mathematical operations can be done with numeric variables only. Both are character variables. Hence COUPON will have missing numeric values. Applying input function changes character value to numeric values which makes code to calculate coupon value. Percent4. And dollar5. Functions will read values without an error.

Question:
The following SAS program is submitted:

data work.total;
set work.salary(keep = department wagerate);
by department;
if first.department then payroll = 0;
payroll + wagerate;
if last.department;
run;

The SAS data set named WORK.SALARY contains 10 observations for each department, currently ordered by DEPARTMENT.

Which one of the following is true regarding the program above?
A. The BY statement in the DATA step causes a syntax error.
B. FIRST.DEPARTMENT and LAST.DEPARTMENT are variables in the WORK.TOTAL data set.
C. The values of the variable PAYROLL represent the total for each department in the WORK.SALARY data set.
D. The values of the variable PAYROLL represent a total for all values of WAGERATE in the WORK.SALARY data set.

Answer: C
Description: When you use PAYROLL + WAGERATE, variable payroll will automatically be retained through-out the dataset. Its values are resettled at first observation of each department. The observations to output dataset total are output on last observation of each department. So number of observation in total dataset is number of departments in salary dataset. Moreover, wagerate is getting added to payroll and that value is retained in payroll variable until the next observation of same department is read. After that second observation wagerate gets added to payroll, so on and so forth until all the 10 observations are read for a department. At last observation, payroll has the sum of all wagerate for that particular department and is outputted to total dataset. Hence answer is C.
For every BY group we get the sum of wagerate in the Payroll variable for each department.

calls + 1;
end;
run;

Which one of the following is the value of the variable CALLS in the output data set?
A. 4
B. 5
C. 6
D. 7

Answer: D
Description: DO WHILE loop executes till we get a false value. Now, calls=6 is equal to 6 therefore calls less than equal to 6 is TRUE. DO LOOP is executed. So, on next execution, calls = calls +1 = 7. Now, calls=7 is greater than 6 therefore calls le 6 is FALSE. DO LOOP is not executed.
Hence, the value of calls remains 7

Question:
Which one of the following is true of the RETAIN statement in a SAS DATA step program?
A. It can be used to assign an initial value to _N_ .
B. It is only valid in conjunction with a SUM function.
C. It has no effect on variables read with the SET, MERGE and UPDATE statements.
D. It adds the value of an expression to an accumulator variable and ignores missing values.

Answer: C
Description: The RETAIN statement
- is a compile-time only statement that creates variables if they do not already exist
- initializes the retained variable to missing before the first execution of the DATA step if you do not supply an initial value
- has no effect on variables that are read with SET, MERGE, or UPDATE statements.

Question:

A. totquantity + quantity;
B. totquantity = sum(totquantity + quantity);
C. totquantity 0;
sum totquantity;
D. retain totquantity 0;
totquantity = totquantity + quantity;

Answer: A
Description: When we put the statement totquantity + quantity , it initializes to zero in the first iteration and adds the quantity and gets the fist totquantity. and so forth. retain will not work in this data set. if you put the retain statement it will stop once reads the missing value the totquantity will be missing value ( . )

Question:
A raw data file is listed below:
--------10-------20-------30

infile 'file-specification';
input item $ cost;
run;

Which one of the following completes the program and produces a grand total for all COST values?
A. grandtot = sum cost;
B. grandtot = sum(grandtot,cost);
C. retain grandtot 0;
grandtot = sum(grandtot,cost);
D. grandtot = sum(grandtot,cost);
output grandtot;

Answer: C
Description: sum is a function which means it will need brackets () so A is not the correct answer. There no such variable as grandtot, so program will give syntax error, so option B and D is not the correct answer. C is the correct option because retain statement is creating a new variable and initializing it with zero. Sum function will add cost to grandtot for each observation and as grandtot is retained it will carry forward the added value.

Question:
The following SAS program is submitted:

data work.total;
set work.salary(keep = department wagerate);
by department;
if first.department then payroll = 0;
payroll + wagerate;
if last.department;

Which one of the following represents how many observations the WORK.TOTAL data set contains?
A. 5
B. 20
C. 100
D. 500

Answer: A
Description: The data is sorted by department, thus we can think there are five subgroup in the dataset: dep1-dep5. Within each group, sas computes the payroll+wagerate value, and sas outputs observations when it reaches the last observation in each subgroup. Thus there will be five observations.


Question:
The following SAS program is submitted:

data work.passengers;
if OrigPassengers = . then
OrigPassengers = 100;
TransPassengers = 100;
OrigPassengers = .;
NonPaying = 10;
TotalPassengers = sum (OrigPassengers, TransPassengers);
run;

Which one of the following is the value of the TOTALPASSENGERS variable in the output data set?
A. 100
B. 110
C. 200
D. . (missing numeric value)

Answer: A
Description: PDV initializes all variables in data step to missing first. So if statement yields true, so value of origpassenger becomes 100. Then transpassenger is assigned value of 100. Next step value of origpassenger is overwritten with missing value. So when you add using sum function which ignores missing value, values of orignpassenger and transpassenger ie sum(.,100) gives you 100. Thus answer is A.
All summary function ignore missing value when computing values whereas operators like + - / * etc do not ignore missing. Thus SUM function will give non missing output as long as their is at least one variable with non missing value. Whereas the operator will always give missing as long as at least one variable in operation is missing.

Description: The two proc sorts are arranged in descending order. However, the merge is in ascending order. Hence, the two data sets won't be merged. In merge if you choose to sort by descending then you must use descending with merge statement otherwise it will not merge because of reason ( C ). It does not matter if you sort by descending order.

Question:
The SAS data sets WORK.EMPLOYEE and WORK.SALARY are shown below:
WORK.EMPLOYEE WORK.SALARY
fname	age	name	salary
Bruce	30	Bruce	25000
Dan		40	Bruce	35000
			Dan	    25000

The following SAS program is submitted:

data work.empdata;

by fname;
totsal + salary;
run;

Which one of the following statements completes the merge of the two data sets by the FNAME variable?
A. merge work.employee
work.salary (fname = name);
B. merge work.employee
work.salary (name = fname);
C. merge work.employee
work.salary (rename = (fname = name));
D. merge work.employee
work.salary (rename = (name = fname));

Answer: D
Description: Because the two data sets are merged by fname variable. You need to rename the name variable of the salary data set to fname. Correct way to rename is (rename = (name = fname))

Question:
The SAS data sets WORK.EMPLOYEE and WORK.SALARY are listed below:
WORK.EMPLOYEE WORK.SALARY
fname   age     fname   salary

by name;
if ine and ins;
run;

A. 4
B. 3
C. 2
D. 1

Answer: A
Description: In this question, the type of the merge is exact merge, since in=ine and in=ins. We do not check any conditions i.e. we do not bother what observations are common to work.employee and work.salary. We simply merge all the observations from both the datasets and write it to emplsal.

Question:
The following SAS program is submitted:

data work.empsalary;
set work.people (in = inemp)
work.money (in = insal);

But even when style is not condo or ranch when run statement is executed output will be written with just style variable having value and all others will be missing.

Question:
The contents of the raw data file FURNITURE are listed below:
--------10-------20-------30
chair,,table
chair,couch,table

The following SAS program is submitted:

data stock;
infile 'furniture' dsd;
input item1 $ item2 $ item3 $;
run;

Which one of the following is the value of the variable named ITEM2 in the first observation of the output data set?
A. table
B. ,table
C. . (missing numeric value)
D. ' ' (missing character value)

Answer: D
Description: with DSD option two consecutive delimiters are not consider as one, so missing value is assigned to item2 and as item2 is character variable it has missing character value " ".

Question:
The following SAS program is submitted and reads 100 records from a raw data file:

data work.total;
infile 'file-specification' end = eof;
input name $ salary;
totsal + salary;
run;

Which one of the following IF statements writes the last observation to the output data set?
A. if end = 0;
B. if eof = 0;
C. if end = 1;
D. if eof = 1;

Answer: D
Description: End is a sas keyword which will become true when SAS reads last record of a dataset. This value you cannot use directly in your program, so we create a alias name eof (end of file), but you can name it anything. EOF will carry the same value as internal variable END. So as we know 1=true and 0= false. if EOF = 1; will output only the last observation.

prod + 1;
end;
run;

Which one of the following is the value of the variable PROD in the output data set?
A. 5
B. 6
C. 7
D. 8

Answer: C
Description: Because of prod + 1 statement, SAS compiler will assume a retain prod 0; statement.
First loop => prod = 1 => (1 gt 6) => false, loop continues
Second loop => prod = 2 => (2 gt 6) => false, loop continues
.....
last loop => prod = 7 => (7 gt 6) => true, do until loop exits and pdv writes prod value of 7 to output dataset.

Question:
The following SAS program is submitted:

data work.new;
length word $7;
amount = 7;
if amount = 5 then word = 'CAT';
else if amount = 7 then word = 'DOG';
else word = 'NONE!!!';
amount = 5;
run;

Which one of the following represents the values of the AMOUNT and WORD variables?
A. amount word
5 DOG
B. amount word
5 CAT
C. amount word
7 DOG
D. amount word
7 ' ' (missing character value)

Answer: A
Description: When SAS reads in the iterations in sequence, it first writes 7 to the variable 'amount' in PDV. Then it reads through the condition and writes 'DOG' for variable 'word' in PDV. Then it again encounters the value 5 and writes to 'Amount' in PDV.

Question:
When the following SAS program is submitted, the data set SASDATA.PRDSALES contains 5000 observations:

libname sasdata 'SAS-data-library';
options obs = 500;
proc print data = sasdata.prdsales (firstobs = 100);
run;
options obs = max;
proc means data = sasdata.prdsales (firstobs = 500);
run;

How many observations are processed by each procedure?
A. 400 for PROC PRINT
4500 for PROC MEANS
B. 401 for PROC PRINT
4501 for PROC MEANS
C. 401 for PROC PRINT
4500 for PROC MEANS
D. 500 for PROC PRINT
5000 for PROC MEANS

Answer: B
Description: OBS option will let SAS know last observation to process. FIRSTOBS option will let SAS know first observation to process. So for first proc print FIRSTOBS =100 and OBS (i like to call it LASTOBS) = 500, so there are 401 observation (including 100th observation) processed by it. Now for proc means FIRSTOBS=500 and OBS (or LASTOBS) = Max (or 5000 in this case), so there are 4501 observation (including 500th observation) is processed by it.

Question:
In the following SAS program, the input data files are sorted by the NAMES variable:
libname temp 'SAS-data-library';
data temp.sales;
merge temp.sales work.receipt;
by names;
run;

Which one of the following results occurs when this program is submitted?
A. The program executes successfully and a temporary SAS data set is created.
B. The program executes successfully and a permanent SAS data set is created.
C. The program fails execution because the same SAS data set is referenced for both read and write operations.
D. The program fails execution because the SAS data sets on the MERGE statement are in two different libraries.

Answer: B
Description: temp is declared as a permanent library so permanent dataset will be created.

Question:
Flat file structure is as below
 1----5----10
dan 23 45
bob 44 50
sue 30 80
mam 40 50
The following code is submitted:
data temp;
infile ‘file specification’;
 input x $ 1-3;
if x='sue' then input age 5-6;
else input height 8-9;
run;

What would be the value of variable AGE in the dataset TEMP when variable X has the value ‘Sue’?

A. 44
B. 30
C. 40
D. 55

Answer:  C
Description: The IF statement containing value of 'x' has a single iteration and it read value of age from the next line i.e from iteration of another line which has age value 40. To eliminate this error put @ sign at the end of input statement. INPUT X $1-3 /*needs*/ @;.

Question:
The following code is submitted:

data temp;
salary='20000';
bonus=0.1*salary;
run;

What would be the value of BONUS variable in the dataset TEMP?

A. '2000'
B. 2000
C. . (Missing value)
D. blank

Answer: B
Description: to an extent, SAS automatically converts character to numeric. even though cost is character. due to automatic conversion here we are getting 2000.
SAS will consider '20000' as a numeric value and thus value of BONUS variable is 200.

Question:

john McCloskey 35 71
June Rosesette 10 43
Tineke Jones 9 37
The following SAS program is submitted using the raw data file as input:

data work.homework;
infile 'file-specification';
input name $ age height;
if age LE 10;
run;

How many observations will the WORK.HOMEWORK dataset contain?

A. 0
B. 3
C. 2
D. No dataset is created as the program fails to execute due to errors

Answer: B
Description: The name has a blank in it so SAS will consider second name value as numeric value and will have missing values under the age variable. As SAS considers missing values smaller than 10 in age variable so it has included all the three observation in the data set. To remove this error use the '&' list modifier to read the data, also when using this we have to make sure that the data are at least two spaces apart.

Question:
The attribute information includes the variable’s name, type, ......

Some of the dataset options are:
A. renaming variables
B. selecting only the first or last n observations for processing
C. dropping variables from processing or from the output data set
D. All of the Above

Answer: D

Question:
The general form of SUM statement is

A. variable = variable+expression;
B. variable+expression;
C. sum(expression,variable)
D. expression=variable+expression;

Answer: B
Description: The variable is automatically set to 0 before SAS reads the first observation. The variable's value is retained from one iteration to the next, as if it had appeared in a RETAIN statement. To initialize a sum variable to a value other than 0, include it in a RETAIN statement with an initial value. The expression is evaluated and the result added to the accumulator variable.
SAS treats an expression that produces a missing value as zero.


Question:
The following SAS program is submitted:

data work.products;
Product_Number = 5461;
Item = '1001';
Item_Reference = Item||'/'||Product_Number;
run;

Which one of the following is the value of the variable ITEM_REFERENCE in the output data set?
A. 1001/5461
B. 1001/ 5461
C. . (missing numeric value)
D. The value cannot be determined as the program fails to execute due to errors.
Answer: B
Description: Concatenation of two creates leading blanks before Product_Number. You can eliminate these blanks using strip function.


Question:
The following SAS program is submitted:
proc report data = work.houses nowd;
    column style price;
    where prices <100000;

SPLIT	65,850
	94,450
	73,650
TWOSTORY 55,850
	69,250

Assume permanent variable labels have been assigned.
Which one of the following completes the program and produces the output displayed in the exhibit?
A. define style / display width = 9;
define price / sum format = comma9. width = 10;
B. define style / width = 9;
define price / sum format = comma9. width = 10;
C. define style / group width = 9;
define price / sum format = comma9. width = 10;
D. define style / order width = 9;
define price / sum format = comma9. width = 10;

Answer: D
Description: Display option in define statement shows observation in order they appear in dataset so, option A is wrong. group option in define statement shows observation in group with total of their price so, option C is wrong. order option in define statement arrange all observation alphabetically with width 9 hence D is correct answer.

Assuming that the PRICE variable is numeric, which one of the following completes the program and produces the output displayed in the exhibit?
A. define style / group 'Style';
define price / mean 'Price' format = dollar9.;
B. define style / display 'Style';
define price / across 'Price' format = dollar9.;
C. define style / display 'Style';
define price / sum 'Price' format = dollar9.;
D. define style / order 'Style';
define price / mean 'Price' format = dollar9.;

Answer: C
Description: group define type in style statement groups all style values hence A is wrong. Across option in define price statement converts price value in variable, hence B is wrong. D cannot be true because 'order' option in 'define style' statement put obs in alphabetical order. only C gives desired output.

run;

Answer: D
Description: The colon ( : ) modifier enables you to read nonstandard data values and character values that are longer than eight characters, but which contain no embedded blanks. DSD option treats consecutive delimeter as a blank. The DLM= option enables you to list read data with delimiters rather than the default space. i.e., if your data are separated by ";", you can use DLM=';' to read them correctly. Since data is seperated by '*' and consecutive delimeter in line 2 so, DLM and DSD option is needed.

Question:
The following SAS program is submitted and reads 100 records from a raw data file:

Data work.total;
Infile ‘file specification’ end=eof;
Input name $ salary;
Totsal + salary;
Run;

Which IF statement writes the final observation to the final data set?
A. if end =1
B. if eof = 0
C. if eof =1
D. if last =0

Answer: C
Description: end is sas keyword which will become true when SAS reads last record of a dataset. This value you cannot use directly in your program, so we create a alias name eof (end of file), but you can name it anything. EOF will carry the same value as internal variable END. So as we know 1=true and 0= false. if EOF = 1; will output only the last observation.

Question: 
Suppose the variable 'Unit_Cost_Price' (numeric) contains both missing and non missing values. What would the following code return?

proc sort data=ecsql1.price_list;
 by Unit_Cost_Price;
run;

A. A new dataset work.price_list is created with Unit_Cost_Price sorted in ascending order with missing values at the bottom of the dataset
B. The dataset ecsql1.price_list is sorted with Unit_Cost_Price sorted in descending order with missing values at the bottom of the dataset
C. A new dataset work.price_list is created with Unit_Cost_Price sorted in descending order with missing values at the top of the dataset
D. The dataset ecsql1.price_list is sorted with Unit_Cost_Price sorted in ascending order with missing values at the top of the dataset

Answer: D
Description: It is because missing values are considered as lowest possible values (ascending order; they will be top of the data set)

Question: 
The following SAS program is submitted:

dta work.il_corn;
set corn.state_data;
if state = 'Illinois';
run;

The keyword "data" is misspelled above. What happens to this program during the compilation phase assuming "corn" is a valid libref?

A. The program fails due to syntax errors
B. The DATA step compiles but doesn't execute
C. The DATA step compiles and executes
D. None of the above

Answer: C.
Description: It compiles and executes as SAS assumed that the 'dta' was data. But it leaves a warning in log window.
The log shows the following warning :
WARNING 1-322: Assuming the symbol DATA was misspelled as dta.
141 run;

This statement produces:

A. no SAS dataset
B. a SAS dataset named null
C. a SAS dataset named _null_
D. the largest possible dataset

Answer: A.
Description: The data _null_ does not produce a dataset.
It is used mainly for the following purposes :
1. To create macro variables with call symput
2. To create customized reports with PUT statements writing to external files.

Question:
You have executed following SAS DATA step as on Monday, April 01, 2000:
data joiners;
set joinee;
join_date = today();
run;

Which one of the following is the value of the variable JOIN_DATE in the output data set?
A. This will be a character string with the value '04/01/2000'
B. This will be a character string with the value 'Monday, April 01, 2000'
C. This will be a numeric value 14701, representing the SAS date for April 01, 2000
D. This will be a numeric value 04252000, representing the SAS date for April 01, 2000
Answer: C
Description: Today's date is given in the SAS date form
The Ans is: the numeric value 14701
The TODAY function produces the current date in the form of a SAS date value, which is the number of days since January 1, 1960.

Question:
How many program steps are executed when the program below is processed?

data user.tables;
infile jobs;
input date name $ job $;
run;
proc sort data=user.tables;
by name;
run;
proc print data=user.tables;
run;

A. three
B. four
C. five
D. six
Answer: A
Description: When it encounters a DATA, PROC, or RUN statement, SAS stops reading statements and executes the previous step in the program. The program above contains one DATA step and two PROC steps, for a total of three program steps.

Question:
If you submit the following program, how does the output look?
options pagesize=55 nonumber;
proc tabulate data=clinic.admit;
class actlevel;
var age height weight;
table actlevel,(age height weight)*mean;
run;
options linesize=80;
proc means data=clinic.heart min max maxdec=1;
var arterial heart cardiac urinary;
class survive sex;
run;
A. The PROC MEANS output has a print line width of 80 characters, but the
PROC TABULATE output has no print line width.
B. The PROC TABULATE output has no page numbers, but the PROC
MEANS output has page numbers.
C. Each page of output from both PROC steps is 55 lines long and has no
page numbers, and the PROC MEANS output has a print line width of 80
characters.
D. The date does not appear on output from either PROC step.

Answer: C
Description: When you specify a system option, it remains in effect until you change the option or end your SAS session, so both PROC steps generate output that is printed 55 lines per page with
no page numbers. If you don't specify a system option, SAS uses the default value for that system option.


Question:
In order for the date values 05May1955 and 04Mar2046 to be read correctly,
what value must the YEARCUTOFF= option have?
A. a value between 1947 and 1954, inclusive
B. 1955 or higher
C. 1946 or higher
D. any value

Answer: D
Description: As long as you specify an informat with the correct field width for reading the entire date value, the YEARCUTOFF= option doesn't affect date values that have four-digit years.

Question:
When you specify an engine for a library, you are always specifying
A.  The file format for files that are stored in the library.
B.  The version of SAS that you are using.
C.  Access to other software vendors' files.
D.  Instructions for creating temporary SAS files.

Answer: A
Description: A SAS engine is a set of internal instructions that SAS uses for writing to and reading from files in a SAS library. Each engine specifies the file format for files that are stored in the
library, which in turn enables SAS to access files with a particular format. Some engines access SAS files, and other engines support access to other vendors' files.


Question:
Which statement prints a summary of all the files stored in the library named
Area51?
A. proc contents data=area51._all_ nods;
B. proc contents data=area51 _all_ nods;
C. proc contents data=area51 _all_ noobs;
D. proc contents data=area51 _all_.nods;

Answer: A
Description: To print a summary of library contents with the CONTENTS procedure, use a period to append the _ALL_ option to the libref. Adding the NODS option suppresses detailed information about the files.

Question:
The following PROC PRINT output was created immediately after PROC TABULATE output. Which SAS system options were specified when the report was created?

A. OBS=, DATE, and NONUMBER
B. PAGENO=1 and DATE
C. NUMBER and DATE only
D. none of the above

Answer: B
Description: Clearly, the DATE and PAGENO= options are specified. Because the page number on the output is 1, even though PROC TABULATE output was just produced. If you don't specify PAGENO=, all output in the Output window is numbered sequentially throughout your SAS session.

Question:
Which of the following programs correctly references a SAS data set named SalesAnalysis that is stored in a permanent SAS library?
A. data saleslibrary.salesanalysis;
set mydata.quarter1sales;
if sales>100000;
run;
B. data mysales.totals;
set sales_99.salesanalysis;
if totalsales>50000;
run;
C. proc print data=salesanalysis.quarter1;
var sales salesrep month;
run;
D. proc freq data=1999data.salesanalysis;
tables quarter*sales;
run;
Answer: B
Description: Librefs must be 1 to 8 characters long, must begin with a letter or underscore, and can contain only letters, numbers, or underscores. After you assign a libref, you specify it as the first element in the two-level name for a SAS file.

Question:
Which time span is used to interpret two-digit year values if the YEARCUTOFF= option is set to 1950?
A. 1950-2049
B. 1950-2050
C. 1949-2050
D. 1950-2000
Answer: A
Description: The YEARCUTOFF= option specifies which 100-year span is used to interpret two-digit year values. The default value of YEARCUTOFF= is 1920. However, you can override the default and change the value of YEARCUTOFF= to the first year of another 100-year span. If you specify YEARCUTOFF=1950, then the 100-year span will be from 1950 to 2049.


Question:
Assuming you are using SAS code and not special SAS windows, which one of the following statements is false?
A. LIBNAME statements can be stored with a SAS program to reference the SAS library automatically when you submit the program.
B. When you delete a libref, SAS no longer has access to the files in the library. However, the contents of the library still exist on your operating system.
C. Librefs can last from one SAS session to another.
D. You can access files that were created with other vendors' software by submitting a LIBNAME statement.
Answer: C
Description: The LIBNAME statement is global, which means that librefs remain in effect until you modify them, cancel them, or end your SAS session. Therefore, the LIBNAME statement assigns the libref for the current SAS session only. You must assign a libref before accessing SAS files that are stored in a permanent SAS data library.

Question:
What does the following statement do?
libname osiris spss 'c:\myfiles\sasdata\data';
A. defines a library called Spss using the OSIRIS engine
B. defines a library called Osiris using the SPSS engine
C. defines two libraries called Osiris and Spss using the default engine
D. defines the default library using the OSIRIS and SPSS engines
Answer: B
Description: In the LIBNAME statement, you specify the library name before the engine name. Both are followed by the path.


Question:
What does the following OPTIONS statement do?
options pagesize=15 nodate;
A. suppresses the date and limits the page size of the log
B. suppresses the date and limits the vertical page size for text output
C. suppresses the date and limits the vertical page size for text and HTML output
D. suppresses the date and limits the horizontal page size for text output
Answer: B
Description: These options affect the format of listing output only. NODATE suppresses the date and PAGESIZE= determines the number of rows to print on the page.


Question:
What usually happens when a syntax error is detected?
A. SAS continues processing the step.
B. SAS continues to process the step, and the SAS log displays messages about
the error.
C. SAS stops processing the step in which the error occurred, and the SAS log
displays messages about the error.
D. SAS stops processing the step in which the error occurred, and the Output
window displays messages about the error.
Answer: C
Description: Syntax errors generally cause SAS to stop processing the step in which the error occurred.
When a program that contains an error is submitted, messages regarding the problem also
appear in the SAS log. When a syntax error is detected, the SAS log displays the word
ERROR, identifies the possible location of the error, and gives an explanation of the error.

Question:
A syntax error occurs when
A. some data values are not appropriate for the SAS statements that are specified in a program.
B. the form of the elements in a SAS statement is correct, but the elements are not valid for that usage.
C. program statements do not conform to the rules of the SAS language.
D. None of the above.
Answer: C
Description: Syntax errors are common types of errors. Some SAS system options, features of the Editor window, and the DATA step debugger can help you identify syntax errors. Other types of
errors include data errors, semantic errors, and execution-time errors.

Question:
How can you tell whether you have specified an invalid option in a SAS program?
A. A log message indicates an error in a statement that seems to be valid.
B. A log message indicates that an option is not valid or not recognized.
C. The message "PROC running" or "DATA step running" appears at the top of the active window.
D. You can't tell until you view the output from the program.

Answer: B
Description: When you submit a SAS statement that contains an invalid option, a log message notifies you that the option is not valid or not recognized. You should recall the program, remove or replace the invalid option, check your statement syntax as needed, and resubmit the corrected program.

Question:
Which of the following programs contain a syntax error?
A. proc sort data=sasuser.mysales;
by region;
run;
B. dat sasuser.mysales;
set mydata.sales99;
run;
C. proc print data=sasuser.mysales label;
label region='Sales Region';
run;
D. None of the above.
Answer: B
Description: The DATA step contains a misspelled keyword (dat instead of data). However, this is such a common (and easily interpretable) error that SAS produces only a warning message, not an error.

Question:
What does the following log indicate about your program?
proc print data=sasuser.cargo99
var origin dest cargorev;
22
76
ERROR 22-322: Syntax error, expecting one of the
following:
;, (, DATA, DOUBLE, HEADING, LABEL,
N, NOOBS, OBS, ROUND, ROWS, SPLIT, STYLE,
UNIFORM, WIDTH.
ERROR 76-322: Syntax error, statement will be ignored.
11 run;
A. SAS identifies a syntax error at the position of the VAR statement.
B. SAS is reading VAR as an option in the PROC PRINT statement.
C. SAS has stopped processing the program because of errors.
D. all of the above
Answer: D
Description: Because there is a missing semicolon at the end of the PROC PRINT statement, SAS interprets VAR as an option in PROC PRINT and finds a syntax error at that location. SAS stops processing programs when it encounters a syntax error.


Question:
Which PROC PRINT step below creates the following output?
Date On Changed Flight
04MAR99 232 18 219
05MAR99 160 4 219

var boarded transferred flight;
label boarded='On' transferred='Changed';
where flight='219';
run;
D. proc print flights.laguardia noobs;
id date;
var date on changed flight;
where flight='219';
run;
Answer: C
Description: The DATA= option specifies the data set that you are listing, and the ID statement replaces the Obs column with the specified variable. The VAR statement specifies variables and controls the order in which they appear, and the WHERE statement selects rows based on a condition. The LABEL option in the PROC PRINT statement causes the labels that are
specified in the LABEL statement to be displayed.

Question:
Which of the following PROC PRINT steps is correct if labels are not stored with the data set?
A. proc print data=allsales.totals label;
label region8='Region 8 Yearly Totals';
run;
B. proc print data=allsales.totals; label region8='Region
8 Yearly Totals';
run;
C. proc print data allsales.totals label noobs;
run;
D. proc print allsales.totals label;
run;
Answer: A
Description: You use the DATA= option to specify the data set to be printed. The LABEL option specifies that variable labels appear in output instead of variable names.


Question:
Which of the following statements selects from a data set only those observations for
which the value of the variable Style is RANCH, SPLIT, or TWOSTORY?
A. where style='RANCH' or 'SPLIT' or 'TWOSTORY';
B. where style in 'RANCH' or 'SPLIT' or 'TWOSTORY';
C. where style in (RANCH, SPLIT, TWOSTORY);
D. where style in ('RANCH','SPLIT','TWOSTORY');
Answer: D
Description: In the WHERE statement, the IN operator enables you to select observations based on several values. You specify values in parentheses and separate them by spaces or commas. Character values must be enclosed in quotation marks and must be in the same case as in the data set.

Question:
If you want to sort your data and create a temporary data set named Calc to store the
sorted data, which of the following steps should you submit?
A. proc sort data=work.calc out=finance.dividend;
run;
B. proc sort dividend out=calc;
by account;
run;
C. proc sort data=finance.dividend out=work.calc;
by account;
run;
D. proc sort from finance.dividend to calc;
by account;
run;
Answer: C
Description: In a PROC SORT step, you specify the DATA= option to specify the data set to sort. The OUT= option specifies an output data set. The required BY statement specifies the variable(s) to use in sorting the data.


Question:
Which options are used to create the following PROC PRINT output?
13:27 Monday, March 22, 1999
Patient	Arterial	Heart	Cardiac	Urinary
203 	88			95		66		110

A. the DATE system option and the LABEL option in PROC PRINT
B. the DATE and NONUMBER system options and the DOUBLE and NOOBS options in PROC PRINT
C. the DATE and NONUMBER system options and the DOUBLE option in PROC PRINT
D. the DATE and NONUMBER system options and the NOOBS option in PROC PRINT
Answer: B
Description: The DATE and NONUMBER system options cause the output to appear with the date but without page numbers. In the PROC PRINT step, the DOUBLE option specifies double spacing, and the NOOBS option removes the default Obs column.

Question:
Which of the following statements can you use in a PROC PRINT step to create this output?
Month	Instructors	AerClass	WalkJogRun	Swim
01		1			37			91			83
02		2			41			102			27
03		1			52			98			19
04		1			61			118			22

A. var month instructors;
sum instructors aerclass walkjogrun swim;
B. var month;
sum instructors aerclass walkjogrun swim;
C. var month instructors aerclass;
sum instructors aerclass walkjogrun swim;
D. all of the above
Answer: D
Description: You do not need to name the variables in a VAR statement if you specify them in the SUM statement, but you can. If you choose not to name the variables in the VAR statement as well, then the SUM statement determines the order of the variables in the output.

Question:
What happens if you submit the following program?
proc sort data=clinic.diabetes;
run;
proc print data=clinic.diabetes;
var age height weight pulse;
where sex='F';
run;
103
A. The PROC PRINT step runs successfully, printing observations in their sorted order.
B. The PROC SORT step permanently sorts the input data set.
C. The PROC SORT step generates errors and stops processing, but the PROC PRINT step runs successfully, printing observations in their original (unsorted) order.
D. The PROC SORT step runs successfully, but the PROC PRINT step
generates errors and stops processing.
Answer: C
Description: The BY statement is required in PROC SORT. Without it, the PROC SORT step fails. However, the PROC PRINT step prints the original data set as requested.


Question:
If you submit the following program, which output does it create?
proc sort data=finance.loans out=work.loans;
by months amount;
run;
proc print data=work.loans noobs;
var months;
sum amount payment;
where months<360;
run;
A. Months Amount Payment
12 $3,500 $308.52
24 $8,700 $403.47
36 $10,000 $325.02
48 $5,000 $128.02
$27,200 $1,165.03
B. Months Amount Payment
12 $3,500 $308.52
24 $8,700 $403.47
36 $10,000 $325.02
48 $5,000 $128.02
27,200 1,165.03
C. Months Amount Payment
12 $3,500 $308.52
48 $5,000 $128.02
24 $8,700 $403.47
36 $10,000 $325.02
$27,200 $1,165.03
D. Months Amount Payment
12 $3,500 $308.52
24 $8,700 $403.47
36 $10,000 $325.02
48 $5,000 $128.02
$1,165.03
Answer: A
Description: Column totals appear at the end of the report in the same format as the values of the variables, so B is incorrect. Work.Loans is sorted by Month and Amount, so c is incorrect.
The program sums both Amount and Payment, so d is incorrect.

Question:
Choose the statement below that selects rows in which
_ the amount is less than or equal to $5000
_ the account is 101–1092, or the rate equals 0.095.
A. where amount <= 5000 and
account='101-1092' or rate = 0.095;
B. where (amount le 5000 and account='101-1092')
or rate = 0.095;
C. where amount <= 5000 and
(account='101-1092' or rate eq 0.095);
D. where amount <= 5000 or account='101-1092'
and rate = 0.095;
Answer: C
Description: To ensure that the compound expression is evaluated correctly, you can use parentheses to group. Second condition is complex condition working differently with first condition thats why we need to put parentheses for a second condition.


Question:
What does PROC PRINT display by default?
A. PROC PRINT does not create a default report; you must specify the rows and columns to be displayed.
B. PROC PRINT displays all observations and variables in the data set. If you want an additional column for observation numbers, you can request it.
C. PROC PRINT displays columns in the following order: a column for
observation numbers, all character variables, and all numeric variables.
D. PROC PRINT displays all observations and variables in the data set, a column for observation numbers on the far left, and variables in the order in which they occur in the data set.

Answer: D
Description: You can remove the column for observation numbers. You can also specify the variables you want, and you can select observations according to conditions.

Question:
Filerefs remain in effect until
A. you change them.
B. you cancel them.
C. you end your SAS session.
D. all of the above
Answer: D
Description: Like LIBNAME statements, FILENAME statements are global; they remain in effect until you change them, cancel them, or end your SAS session.

Question:
Which statement identifies the name of a raw data file to be read with the fileref
Products and specifies that the DATA step read only records 1–15?
A. infile products obs 15;
B. infile products obs=15;
C. input products obs=15;
D. input products 1-15;
Answer: B
Description: You use an INFILE statement to specify the raw data file to be read. You can specify a fileref or an actual filename (in quotation marks). The OBS= option in the INFILE statement enables you to process only records 1 through n.

Question:
Which of the following programs correctly writes the observations from the data set below to a raw data file? SAS Data Set Work.Patients
ID Sex Age Height Weight Pulse
2304 F 16 61 102 100

file 'c:\clinic\patients\referrals.dat';
put id 1-4 sex 6 age 8-9 height 11-12
weight 14-16 pulse 18-20;
run;

Answer: D
Description: The keyword _NULL_ in the DATA statement enables you to use the power of the DATA step without actually creating a SAS data set. You use the FILE and PUT statements to write out the observations from a SAS data set to a raw data file. The FILE statement specifies the raw
data file and the PUT statement describes the lines to write to the raw data file. The filename and location that are specified in the FILE statement must be enclosed in quotation marks.

Question:

Answer: D
Description: To read instream data, you specify a DATALINES statement and data lines, followed by a null statement (single semicolon) to indicate the end of the input data. Program a contains no DATALINES statement, and the INPUT statement doesn't specify the fields to read. Program B contains no data lines, and the INPUT statement in program c doesn't specify the
necessary dollar signs for the character variables Country and Vehicle.

Question:
Which SAS statement subsets the raw data shown below so that only the observations in which Sex (in the second field) has a value of F are processed?

1-----+-----10-----+----20-----+-----30-----+
Alfred  M 14  69.0 112.5
Becka   F  13 65.5 98.0
Gail    F  14 64.3 90.0
Jeffrey M  13 62.5 84.0
John    M  12 59.0 99.5
Karen   F  12 56.3 77.0
Mary    F  15 66.5 112.0
Philip  M  16 72.0 150.0
Sandy   F  11 51.3 50.5
Tammy   F  14 62.8 102.5
William M  15 66.5 112.0

A. if sex=f;
B. if sex=F;
C. if sex='F';
D. a or b
Answer: C
Description: To subset data, you can use a sub-setting IF statement in any DATA steps to process only those observations that meet a specified condition. Because Sex is a character variable, the value F must be enclosed in quotation marks and must be in the same case as in the data set.

Question:
Which of the following is not created during the compilation phase?
A. the data set descriptor
B. the first observation
C. the program data vector
D. the _N_ and _ERROR_ automatic variables
Answer: B
Description: At the beginning of the compilation phase, the program data vector is created. The program data vector includes the two automatic variables _N_ and _ERROR_. The descriptor portion of the new SAS data set is created at the end of the compilation phase. The descriptor portion includes the name of the data set, the number of observations and variables, and the names and attributes of the variables. Observations are not written until the execution phase.

Question:
During the compilation phase, SAS scans each statement in the DATA step, looking for syntax errors. Which of the following is not considered a syntax error?
A. incorrect values and formats
B. invalid options or variable names
C. missing or invalid punctuation
D. missing or misspelled keywords
Answer: A
Description: Syntax checking can detect many common errors, but it cannot verify the values of variables or the correctness of formats.

Question:
Unless otherwise directed, the DATA step executes
A. Once for each compilation phase.
B. once for each DATA step statement.
C. once for each record in the input file.
D. once for each variable in the input file.
Answer: C
Description: The DATA step executes once for each record in the input file, unless otherwise directed.

Question:
At the beginning of the execution phase, the value of _N_ is 1, the value of _ERROR_ is 0, and the values of the remaining variables are set to
A. 0
B. 1
C. undefined
D. missing
Answer: D
Description: The remaining variables are initialized to missing. Missing numeric values are represented by periods, and missing character values are represented by blanks.

Question:
Suppose you run a program that causes three DATA step errors. What is the value of the automatic variable _ERROR_ when the observation that contains the third error is processed?
A. 0
B. 1
C. 2
D. 3
Answer: B
Description: The default value of _ERROR_ is 0, which means there is no error. When an error occurs, whether it is one error or multiple errors, the value is set to 1.

Question:
Which of the following actions occurs at the end of the DATA step?
A. The automatic variables _N_ and _ERROR_ are incremented by one.
B. The DATA step stops execution.
C. The descriptor portion of the data set is written.
D. The values of variables created in programming statements are re-set to missing in the program data vector.
Answer: D
Description: By default, at the end of the DATA step, the values in the program data vector are written to the data set as an observation, the value of the automatic variable _N_ is incremented by one, control returns to the top of the DATA step, and the values of variables created in programming statements are set to missing. The automatic variable _ERROR_ retains its value.

Question:
Look carefully at the DATA step shown below. Based on the INPUT statement, in what order will the variables be stored in the new data set?

data perm.update;
infile invent;
input IDnum $ 15-19 Item $ 1-13 Instock 21-22 BackOrd 24-25;
Total=instock+backord;
run;
A. IDnum Item InStock BackOrd Total
B. Item IDnum InStock BackOrd Total
C. Total IDnum Item InStock BackOrd
D. Total Item IDnum InStock BackOrd
Answer: A
Description: The order in which variables are defined in the DATA step determines the order in which the variables are stored in the data set.

Question:
If SAS cannot interpret syntax errors, then
A. data set variables will contain missing values.
B. the DATA step does not compile.
C. the DATA step still compiles, but it does not execute.
D. the DATA step still compiles and executes.
Answer: C
Description: When SAS can't interpret syntax errors, the DATA step compiles, but it does not execute.

Question:
What is wrong with this program?

data perm.update;
infile invent
input Item $ 1-13 IDnum $ 15-19 Instock 21-22;
BackOrd 24-25;
total=instock+backord;
run;
A. missing semicolon on second line
B. missing semicolon on third line
C. incorrect order of variables
D. incorrect variable type
Answer: A
Description: A semicolon is missing from the second line. It will cause an error because the INPUT statement will be interpreted as invalid INFILE statement options.

Question:
Look carefully at this section of a SAS session log. Based on the note, what was the most likely problem with the DATA step?
NOTE: Invalid data for IDnum in line 7 15-19.
RULE: ----+----1----+----2----+----3----+----4
7 Bird Feeder LG088 3 20
Item=Bird Feeder IDnum=. InStock=3 BackOrd=20
Total=23 _ERROR_=1 _N_=1
A. A keyword was misspelled in the DATA step.
B. A semicolon was missing from the INFILE statement.
C. A variable was misspelled in the INPUT statement.
D. A dollar sign was missing in the INPUT statement.
Answer: D
Description: The third line of the log displays the values for IDnum, which are clearly character values. The fourth line displays the values in the program data vector and shows that the values for
IDnum are missing, even though the other values are correctly assigned. Thus, it appears that numeric values were expected for IDnum. A dollar sign, to indicate character values, must be missing from the INPUT statement.

Question:
If you don't specify the LIBRARY= option, your formats are stored in Work.Formats, and they exist
A. Only for the current procedure.
B. Only for the current DATA step.
C. Only for the current SAS session.
D. Permanently.
Answer: C
Description:  If you do not specify the LIBRARY= option, formats are stored in a default format catalog named Work.Formats. As the libref Work implies, any format that is stored in Work.Formats is a temporary format that exists only for the current SAS session.

Question:
Which of the following statements will store your formats in a permanent catalog?
A. libname library 'c:\sas\formats\lib';proc format lib=library ...;
B. libname library 'c:\sas\formats\lib';format lib=library ...;
C. library='c:\sas\formats\lib';proc format library ...;
D. library='c:\sas\formats\lib';proc library ...;

Answer: A
Description: To store formats in a permanent catalog, you first write a LIBNAME statement to associate the libref with the SAS data library in which the catalog will be stored. Then add the LIB= (or LIBRARY=) option to the PROC FORMAT statement, specifying the name of the catalog.

Question:
When creating a format with the VALUE statement, the new format's name
_ cannot end with a number
_ cannot end with a period
_ cannot be the name of a SAS format, and
A. cannot be the name of a data set variable.
B. must be at least two characters long.
C. must be at least eight characters long.
D. must begin with a dollar sign ($) if used with a character variable.

Answer: D
Description: The name of a format that is created with a VALUE statement must begin with a dollar sig ($) if it applies to a character variable.

Question:
Which of the following FORMAT procedures is written correctly?
A. proc format lib=library value colorfmt; 1='Red' 2='Green' 3='Blue' run;
B. proc format lib=library; value colorfmt 1='Red' 2='Green' 3='Blue'; run;
C. proc format lib=library; value colorfmt; 1='Red' 2='Green' 3='Blue' run;
D. proc format lib=library; value colorfmt 1='Red'; 2='Green'; 3='Blue'; run;
Answer: B
Description: A semicolon is needed after the PROC FORMAT statement. The VALUE statement begins with the keyword VALUE and ends with a semicolon after all the labels have been defined.

Question:
Which of these is false? Ranges in the VALUE statement can specify
A. A single value, such as 24 or 'S'.
B. a range of numeric values, such as 0–1500.
C. a range of character values, such as 'A'–'M'.
D. a list of numeric and character values separated by commas, such as 90,'B',180,'D',270.
Answer: D
Description: You can list values separated by commas, but the list must contain either all numeric values or all character values. Data set variables are either numeric or character.

Question:
How many characters can be used in a label?
A. 40
B. 96
C. 200
D. 256
Answer: D
Description: When specifying a label, enclose it in quotation marks and limit the label to 256 characters.

Question:
Which keyword can be used to label missing values as well as any values that are not specified in a range?
A. LOW
B. MISS
C. MISSING
D. OTHER
Answer: D
Description: MISS and MISSING are invalid keywords, and LOW does not include missing values. The keyword OTHER can be used in the VALUE statement to label missing values as well as any values that are not specifically included in a range.

Question:
You can place the FORMAT statement in either a DATA step or a PROC step. What happens when you place the FORMAT statement in a DATA step?
A. You temporarily associate the formats with variables.
B. You permanently associate the formats with variables.
C. You replace the original data with the format labels.
D. You make the formats available to other data sets.
Answer: B
Description: By placing the FORMAT statement in a DATA step, you permanently associate the defined formats with variables.

Question:
The format JOBFMT was created in a FORMAT procedure. Which FORMAT statement will apply it to the variable JobTitle in the program output?
A. format jobtitle jobfmt;
B. format jobtitle jobfmt.;
C. format jobtitle=jobfmt;
D. format jobtitle='jobfmt';
Answer: B
Description: To associate a user-defined format with a variable, place a period at the end of the format name when it is used in the FORMAT statement.

Question:
Which keyword, when added to the PROC FORMAT statement, will display all the formats in your catalog?
A. CATALOG
B. LISTFMT
C. FMTCAT
D. FMTLIB
Answer: D
Description: Adding the keyword FMTLIB to the PROC FORMAT statement displays a list of all the formats in your catalog, along with descriptions of their values.

Answer: A
Description: This program creates a summary report, which consolidates into one row all observations from the data set that have a unique combination of values for the variable Style.

Question:
When you define an order variable?
A. the detail rows are ordered according to their formatted values.
B. you can't create summary reports.
C. PROC REPORT displays only the first occurrence of each order variable value in a set of rows that have the same value for all order variables.
D. all of the above
Answer: D
Description: Order variables do order rows according to the formatted values of the order variable, and PROC REPORT suppresses repetitious printing of order values. However, you can't use order variables in a summary report.

Question:
Where will the ouput(rakesh) be written?

data _null_;
put ‘rakesh’;
run;

A. In Last file opened
B. In dataset _null_
C. Syntax error
