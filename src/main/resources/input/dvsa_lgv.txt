Question:
When is an articulated lorry most likely to jack-knife?

A. When it's carrying a high load
B. When its load is carried at the rear of the trailer
C. When it's unloaded
D. When it's fully loaded

Answer: C
Description: When the trailer is loaded, the weight of the load presses the trailer tyres firmly onto the road surface, so improving the tyres’ grip. Unladen, there is no load bearing down on the tyres, and under heavy braking the trailer wheels can lock or slide across the road surface, making the trailer more difficult to stop. Severe braking can result in jack-knifing: the trailer doesn't slow as quickly as the tractor unit and this causes it to pivot around the coupling.

Question:
What's the greatest risk to your safety when you're overtaking on a motorway in very wet weather?

A. Your braking distance may be reduced
B. Your engine may get flooded
C. Your steering may become heavy
D. Your tyres may lose grip

Answer: D
Description: In very wet conditions, tyres may be unable to clear all the water from their path. This can result in a layer of water building up between the road and the tyre – a situation known as aquaplaning. To regain control, ease off the accelerator and, as the vehicle slows, the tyres should regain their grip. It's safer to reduce the risk of aquaplaning occurring by driving more slowly in very wet weather.

A. When the roads are icy
B. When you're driving in fog
C. When it's raining and the roads are wet
D. When the roads are dry

Answer: D
Description: In good dry conditions, you should leave a two-second gap between your vehicle and the one ahead. When the weather is bad, you'll have to keep a greater distance, because it will take you longer to stop. In wet weather it will take up to twice the distance; in icy weather this could increase to ten times as far.

What should you do if you see a vehicle too close behind when you're driving in traffic on the motorway?

A. Briskly accelerate away from the vehicle behind
B. Touch the brake pedal sharply to show your brake lights
C. Switch your rear fog lamps on and off
D. Increase your distance from the vehicle in front

Answer: D
Description: The faster the traffic is moving, the greater the distance that needs to be kept between vehicles to maintain safety margins. If you find another vehicle driving too close behind you, gradually reduce your speed to increase your distance from the vehicle in front. You’ll then be able to brake more gently when you need to, reducing the likelihood of the vehicle behind running into the back of your vehicle.
Category: The road

Question:
What should you do if an overtaking vehicle pulls in too close in front of you?

A. Overtake when you can
B. Slow down
C. Stay close behind
D. Flash your headlights

Answer: B
Description: Always maintain a safe following distance from the vehicle in front. If another vehicle pulls into the gap, slow down to re-establish a safe following distance.
Following too close is dangerous and places you and other road users in unnecessary danger; your view of the road ahead will be seriously reduced, and you won’t be able to see or plan effectively.

Question:
Your vehicle is fitted with a ‘diff-lock’. When would you normally use it?

A. While uncoupling a trailer
B. While driving on muddy construction sites
C. While driving on straight roads
D. While towing an empty trailer

Answer: B
Description: The differential allows the drive wheels to rotate at different speeds; this is necessary for the vehicle to negotiate corners and bends. On a slippery surface, however, it can cause problems: if one wheel has less traction, it can spin, resulting in a complete loss of drive. The 'diff-lock' prevents the wheels from turning independently and so helps to stop this happening.

How can a lorry driver avoid brake fade?

A. Make sure that the parking brake is applied before stopping
B. Check that the air pressure is correct
C. Ensure that the air tanks are drained before journeys
D. Select an appropriate gear before downhill gradients

Answer: D
Description: Using the brakes to control a lorry’s speed as it's driven down a hill will cause them to get hot. If they overheat, they can become less effective – a condition known as brake fade. By selecting a low gear, the engine’s resistance will slow the lorry. This reduces the demands on the brakes, making them less likely to overheat.
Category: Braking systems

Question:
When are exhaust brakes most efficient?

A. While travelling at a constant speed on a motorway
B. During stop/start town work
C. At high engine speed, while in low gears
D. At low engine speed, while in high gears

Answer: C
Description: An exhaust brake alters the engine’s exhaust flow, using it to help control the vehicle’s speed. It's most efficient when the engine is running at a high speed and the vehicle is in a low gear, such as when descending a long hill. Using the exhaust brake can relieve the service brakes, preventing them from overheating and fading.

You're driving an articulated lorry. What could happen if you change to a lower gear while you're going too fast?

A. The engine could stall
B. The vehicle could jack-knife
C. The trailer could uncouple
D. The brakes could fail

Answer: B
Description: Severe braking or selecting a gear too low for your road speed can cause the tractor unit to slow more quickly than the trailer. The trailer can then pivot around the coupling (fifth wheel), causing the vehicle to jack-knife. Jack-knifing is more likely to occur with an unladen vehicle, particularly on a bend or curve.
Category: Braking systems

Question:
When is an articulated vehicle most at risk of jack-knifing?

A. When it's fully loaded
B. While it's manoeuvring slowly
C. While it's under heavy braking
D. When it's fitted with an endurance brake (retarder)

Answer: C
Description: Heavy braking can cause an articulated vehicle to become unstable and may even lead to jack-knifing; this is more likely to occur when the trailer is unladen.
Category: Braking systems

A. Once the engine has warmed up
B. As soon as the snow has cleared
C. As soon as the vehicle is moving
D. Only after selecting top gear

Answer: C
Description: You must always disengage the diff-lock as soon as the vehicle is moving. The differential allows the rear wheels to revolve at different speeds, and this allows the vehicle to follow a curved path. Attempting to turn with the diff-lock engaged could result in the vehicle continuing straight on.

B. Apply the footbrake firmly in a pumping action until the vehicle has stopped
C. Apply the handbrake only
D. Apply the footbrake firmly and continuously until the vehicle has stopped

Answer: D
Description: When your vehicle has anti-lock brakes and you need to stop in an emergency, you should keep your foot firmly on the brake pedal until the vehicle stops; this will allow the system to work. Although anti-lock brakes contribute to safety, they don’t reduce your stopping distance or take away the need to drive with good planning and anticipation.
Category: Braking systems

Question:
What does changing to a lower gear on a long downhill gradient help to avoid?

A. Tyre wear
B. Clutch slip
C. Excessive engine revs
D. Brake fade

Description: Engaging a lower gear and using engine braking will help you to control your speed as you're going downhill. This reduces the demands on the brakes, and helps to prevent them from overheating. This will reduce the likelihood of brake fade.
Category: Braking systems

Question:
You have to drive onto a muddy building site. Why should you switch on your diff-lock?

A. To make the wheels less likely to spin
B. To improve your fuel consumption
C. To increase your engine power
D. To make your steering lighter

Answer: A
Description: Engaging the diff-lock means that the driven wheels are locked together. This reduces the likelihood of wheel spin. Remember to switch off the diff-lock as soon as you're on firm ground again, otherwise you could damage the transmission.
Category: Braking systems

Question:
How will anti-lock brakes improve your vehicle's safety?

A. They let you drive faster on wet roads
B. They allow you to follow other vehicles more closely
C. They help you keep steering control while braking heavily
D. They enable you to brake later than normal

Answer: C
Description: When your steering wheels are locked – as can happen in a skid – you can't steer the vehicle. Anti-lock brakes help you to keep steering control while you're braking heavily, but they aren't a substitute for good forward planning. Anticipation and planning ahead will minimise the risk of skidding more effectively than relying on your braking system.
Category: Braking systems

Question:
What could prevent air pressure from building up in an air-brake system in frosty weather?

A. Moisture drawn in with the air may freeze and cause a blockage
B. The air will contract, reducing the pressure
C. The dampness may cause valves to rust
D. Moisture in the air may form bubbles in the brake fluid

Answer: A
Description: When air is compressed, moisture condenses and collects in the air tanks. This can find its way along the network of pipes connected to the brakes. In frosty weather, the moisture can freeze in the pipes, blocking them completely. On modern vehicles, the air is dried before it's compressed and the air tanks drain automatically to shed any moisture. On older vehicles, the air tanks need draining manually.
Category: Braking systems

Question:
What should you do if the brake air-pressure warning light comes on while you're driving?

A. Stop and get help without delay

Your vehicle is fitted with an anti-lock braking system. What's it designed to allow you to do?

A. Stop safely in an emergency
B. Drive at faster speeds
C. Apply the brakes more quickly
D. Brake much later than normal

Answer: A
Description: Anti-lock braking systems sense when the wheels are about to lock. The sensor control releases the brakes and immediately applies them again. It will do this many times per second. This both prevents skidding and enables the driver to steer – something that's impossible when the steering wheels are skidding.

What's ‘brake fade’?

A. Reduction of air pressure
B. Low hydraulic brake fluid level
C. Smooth progressive braking
D. Reduction of braking effectiveness

Answer: D
Description: Continually using the brakes could cause them to overheat. When that happens, they become less effective. This is called brake fade, and it occurs most often when the driver has to control the vehicle's speed on a long downhill gradient. To help prevent brake fade, use the endurance brake (retarder) and a lower gear to keep the vehicle's speed in check, rather than the wheel-mounted brakes.
Category: Braking systems

A. When driving in a straight line
B. As you start to turn the wheel
C. When halfway around the bend
D. As close to the bend as possible

Answer: A
Description: When a vehicle changes direction, forces are applied to the vehicle and its load. Braking at the same time can result in additional forces being introduced, and this can lead to a loss of control. For this reason, braking should be carried out while driving in a straight line, so preventing these forces from acting together.

Question:
A horse rider is in the left-hand lane approaching a roundabout. What should you expect the rider to do?

A. Turn left
B. Turn right
C. Go ahead
D. Go in any direction

Answer: D
Description: Horses and their riders will move more slowly than other road users. They might not have time to cut across heavy traffic to take up a position in the offside lane when they're turning right; it could also be hazardous for them to do so. Therefore, a horse and rider may approach a roundabout in the left-hand lane, even though they’re turning right.

Question:
You're at the front of a queue of traffic waiting to turn right into a side road. Why should you check your right-hand mirror just before turning?

A. To check for overtaking vehicles
B. To make sure the side road is clear
C. To look for pedestrians about to cross
D. To check for emerging traffic

Answer: A
Description: Always check your right-hand mirror and blind spot just before you make a right turn, as another vehicle could be overtaking you. Motorcyclists often filter along the outside of traffic queues. Keep checking all your mirrors while you're waiting to turn, because situations behind you can change quickly.
