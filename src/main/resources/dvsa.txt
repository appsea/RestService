Question:
Overall stopping distance is made up of thinking distance and braking distance. You're on a good, dry road surface, with good brakes and tyres. What's the typical braking distance from 50 mph?

A. 14 metres (46 feet)
B. 24 metres (80 feet)
C. 38 metres (125 feet)
D. 55 metres (180 feet)

Answer: C
Description: Be aware that this is just the braking distance. You need to add the thinking distance to this to give the overall stopping distance. At 50 mph, the typical thinking distance will be 15 metres (50 feet), plus a braking distance of 38 metres (125 feet), giving an overall stopping distance of 53 metres (175 feet). The stopping distance could be greater than this, depending on your attention and response to any hazards. These figures are a general guide.

Question:
In heavy motorway traffic, the vehicle behind you is following too closely. How can you lower the risk of a collision?
image: AB2911.gif

A. Increase your distance from the vehicle in front
B. Brake sharply
C. Switch on your hazard warning lights
D. Move onto the hard shoulder and stop

Answer: A
Description: On busy roads, traffic may still travel at high speeds despite being close together. Don’t follow the vehicle in front too closely. If a driver behind seems to be ‘pushing’ you, gradually increase your distance from the vehicle in front by slowing down gently. This will give you more space in front if you have to brake, and will reduce the risk of a collision involving several vehicles.
Category: Safety margins

Question:
You're following other vehicles in fog. You have your lights on. What else can you do to reduce the chances of being in a collision?

A. Keep close to the vehicle in front
B. Use your main beam instead of dipped headlights
C. Keep up with the faster vehicles
D. Reduce your speed and increase the gap in front

Answer: D
Description: When it’s foggy, use dipped headlights. This will help you see and be seen by other road users. If visibility is seriously reduced, consider using front and rear fog lights if you have them. Keep to a sensible speed and don’t follow the vehicle in front too closely. If the road is wet and slippery, you’ll need to allow twice the normal stopping distance.

What will help when you're trying to move off on snow?

A. Use the car's lowest gear 
B. Use a higher gear than normal
C. Use a high engine speed
D. Use the handbrake and footbrake together

Answer: B
Description: If you attempt to move off in a low gear, there will be more torque (turning force) at the driven wheels than if you use a higher gear. More torque makes it easier for the tyres to lose grip and so spin the wheels.
Category: Safety margins

Question:
What should you do when you're driving in snowy conditions?

A. Brake firmly and quickly
B. Be ready to steer sharply
C. Use sidelights only
D. Brake gently in plenty of time

Question:
Anti-lock brakes reduce the chances of skidding. When is this particularly important?

A. When you're driving down steep hills
B. When you're braking during normal driving
C. When you're braking in an emergency
D. When you're driving on good road surfaces

Answer: C
Description: The anti-lock braking system (ABS) will operate when the brakes have been applied harshly and the wheels are about to lock, such as during an emergency. ABS will reduce the likelihood of your car skidding, but it isn't a substitute for safe and responsible driving.
Category: Safety margins

Question:
On what type of road surface may anti-lock brakes not work effectively?

A. Dry
B. Loose
C. Firm
D. Smooth

Answer: B
Description: Poor contact with the road surface could cause one or more of the tyres to lose grip on the road. This is more likely to happen when braking in poor weather conditions and when the road has a loose, slippery or uneven surface.
Category: Safety margins

Question:
When are anti-lock brakes of most use to you?

A. When you’re braking gently
B. When you’re braking on rural roads
C. When you’re braking harshly
D. When you’re braking on a motorway

Answer: C
Description: Anti-lock brakes won't be needed when you're braking normally. Looking well down the road and anticipating possible hazards could prevent you from having to brake late and harshly. Knowing that you have anti-lock brakes isn't an excuse to drive in a careless or reckless way.
Category: Safety margins

Question:
What does driving a vehicle with anti-lock brakes allow you to do?

A. Brake harder because it's impossible to skid
B. Drive at higher speeds
C. Steer and brake harshly at the same time
D. Pay less attention to the road ahead

Answer: C
Description: If the wheels of your vehicle lock, they won't grip the road and you'll lose steering control. In good conditions, the anti-lock braking system (ABS) will prevent the wheels from locking and you'll keep control of your steering. In poor weather conditions or on loose surfaces, the ABS may be less effective.
Category: Safety margins

Question:
You're driving a vehicle that has anti-lock brakes. How should you apply the footbrake when you need to stop in an emergency?

A. Slowly and gently
B. Slowly but firmly
C. Rapidly and gently
D. Rapidly and firmly

Answer: D
Description: You may have to stop in an emergency due to a misjudgement by another driver or a hazard arising suddenly, such as a child running out into the road. If your vehicle has anti-lock brakes, you should apply the brakes immediately and keep them firmly applied until you stop.
Category: Safety margins

Question:
In which conditions are your anti-lock brakes most unlikely to prevent skidding?

A. In foggy conditions
B. At night on unlit roads
C. On loose road surfaces
D. On dry tarmac

Answer: C
Description: Anti-lock brakes may be ineffective on gravel or loose surfaces. They may also be ineffective in very wet weather, when water can build up between the tyre and the road surface; this is known as aquaplaning.

What would suggest you're driving on ice?

A. There's less wind noise
B. There's less tyre noise
C. There's less transmission noise
D. There's less engine noise

Answer: B
Description: Drive extremely carefully when the roads are icy. When travelling on ice, tyres make virtually no noise and the steering feels light and unresponsive.
In icy conditions, be very gentle when braking, accelerating and steering.
Category: Safety margins

Question:
You're driving along a wet road. How can you tell if your vehicle’s tyres are losing their grip on the surface?

A. The engine will stall
B. The steering will feel very heavy
C. The engine noise will increase
D. The steering will feel very light

Answer: D
Description: If you drive at speed in very wet conditions, your steering may suddenly feel lighter than usual. This means that the tyres have lifted off the surface of the road and are skating on the surface of the water. This is known as aquaplaning. Reduce speed but don’t brake until your steering returns to normal.
Category: Safety margins

Question:
In which conditions will your overall stopping distance increase?

A. In the rain
B. In fog
C. At night
D. In strong winds

Answer: A
Description: Extra care should be taken in wet weather. On wet roads, your stopping distance could be double that in dry conditions.

Question:
You're driving on an open road in dry weather. What should the distance be between you and the vehicle in front?
image: BB1657.gif

A. A two-second time gap
B. One car length
C. Two metres (6 feet 6 inches)
D. Two car lengths

Answer: A
Description: One way of checking there's a safe distance between you and the vehicle in front is to use the two-second rule. To check for a two-second time gap, choose a stationary object ahead, such as a bridge or road sign. When the car in front passes the object, say 'Only a fool breaks the two-second rule'. If you reach the object before you finish saying the phrase, you're too close and need to increase the gap.

Question:
How can you use your vehicle’s engine as a brake?

A. By changing to a lower gear
B. By selecting reverse gear
C. By changing to a higher gear
D. By selecting neutral gear

Answer: A
Description: When driving on downhill stretches of road, selecting a lower gear gives increased engine braking. This will prevent excessive use of the brakes, which become less effective if they overheat.
Category: Safety margins

Question:
When are anti-lock brakes (ABS) most effective?

A. When you keep pumping the foot brake to prevent skidding
B. When you brake normally but grip the steering wheel tightly
C. When you brake promptly and firmly until you've stopped
D. When you apply the handbrake to reduce the stopping distance

Answer: C
Description: If you have ABS and need to stop in an emergency, keep your foot firmly on the brake pedal until the vehicle has stopped. When the ABS operates, you may hear a grating sound and feel vibration through the brake pedal. This is normal and you should maintain pressure on the brake pedal until the vehicle stops.
Category: Safety margins

Question:
When will anti-lock brakes take effect?

A. When you don't brake quickly enough
B. When the wheels are about to lock
C. When you haven't seen a hazard ahead
D. When you're speeding on a slippery road surface

Answer: B
Description: If your car is fitted with anti-lock brakes, they'll only activate when they sense that the wheels are about to lock. By preventing the wheels from locking, you'll be able to steer to avoid the hazard, while maximum braking is also applied.

Question:
What can result when you travel for long distances in neutral (known as coasting)?

A. Improvement in control
B. Easier steering
C. Reduction in control
D. Increased fuel consumption

Answer: C
Description: Coasting is the term used when the clutch is held down, or the gear lever is in neutral, and the vehicle is allowed to freewheel. This reduces the driver’s control of the vehicle. When you coast, the engine can’t drive the wheels to stabilise you through a corner, or give the assistance of engine braking to help slow the car.
Category: Safety margins

Question:
What should you do when driving in fog?

A. Use sidelights only
B. Position close to the centre line
C. Allow more time for your journey
D. Keep close to the car in front

Answer: C
Description: Don’t venture out if your journey isn’t necessary. If you have to travel and someone is expecting you at the other end, let them know that you’ll be taking longer than usual for your journey. This will stop them worrying if you don’t turn up on time and will also take the pressure off you, so you don’t feel you have to rush.

Question:
Why should you always reduce your speed when travelling in fog?

A. The brakes don't work as well
B. You'll be dazzled by other headlights
C. The engine will take longer to warm up
D. It's more difficult to see what's ahead

Answer: D
Description: You won’t be able to see as far ahead in fog as you can on a clear day. You'll need to reduce your speed so that, if a hazard looms out of the fog, you have the time and space to take avoiding action.
Travelling in fog is hazardous. If you can, try to delay your journey until it has cleared.

Category: Vehicle handling

Question:
When will you feel the effects of engine braking?

A. When you only use the handbrake
B. When you're in neutral
C. When you change to a lower gear
D. When you change to a higher gear

Answer: C
Description: When you take your foot off the accelerator, engines have a natural resistance to turn, caused mainly by the cylinder compression. Changing to a lower gear requires the engine to turn faster and so it will have greater resistance than when it's made to turn more slowly. When going downhill, changing to a lower gear will therefore help to keep the vehicle's speed in check.

Why is it dangerous to leave rear fog lights on when they’re not needed?

A. They may be confused with brake lights
B. The bulbs would fail
C. Electrical systems could be overloaded
D. Direction indicators may not work properly

Answer: A
Description: If your rear fog lights are left on when it isn’t foggy, the glare they cause makes it difficult for road users behind to know whether you’re braking or you’ve just forgotten to turn off your rear fog lights. This can be a particular problem on wet roads and on motorways. If you leave your rear fog lights on at night, road users behind you are likely to be dazzled and this could put them at risk.
