variable, ship_note, that shows a character value with the order_id, shipped date, and customer
name. For example, given the first observation ship_note would have the value "Order 9341
shipped on 02FEB2009 to Josh Martin".
Which of the following statement will correctly create the value and assign it to ship_note?
A. ship_note=catx(' ','Order',order_id,'shipped on',input(shipped,date9.),'to',customer);
B. ship_note=catx(' ','Order',order_id,'shipped on',char(shipped,date9.),'to',customer);
C. ship_note=catx(' ','Order',order_id,'shipped on',transwrd(shipped,date9.),'to',customer);
D. ship_note=catx(' ','Order',order_id,'shipped on',put(shipped,date9.),'to',customer);
